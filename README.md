### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Konstantina and I currently study Computer Science at Aristotle University Of Thessaloniki. 
I believe technology can make the world a better place. I always try to find a way to participate in projects with that purpose and also love participating in the tech community with organizing events and workshops. I mainly write code in Java, Python and C and through my studies I 've been exploring the field of Web Development (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap5). I am also member of the ACM AUTh Student Chapter and coordinator of the ACM-W chapter's subteam where I participate in organising events with main goal empowering equality in tech.
